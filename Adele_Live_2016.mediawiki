'''Adele Live 2016''' (titled as '''Adele Live 2017''' for the shows in 2017) was the third [[concert tour]] by British singer [[Adele]] in support of her third studio album, ''[[25 (Adele album)|25]]''. It began on 29 February 2016, in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] at the [[SSE Arena, Belfast|SSE Arena]], continued throughout Western Europe, North America and Oceania. It was originally scheduled to conclude on 2 July 2017, in London, England, at [[Wembley Stadium]], however on 30 June Adele announced via social media that she had regretfully cancelled her final two performances upon medical advice due to vocal injuries. It is unlikely the performances will be postponed to a later date.<ref name="announcBilb">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6777820/adele-live-tour-2016|title=Adele Announces 2016 Tour|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=26 November 2015|first=Adelle|last=Platon}}</ref><ref name="anncouncHP">{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/26/adele-tour-live-dates-tickets-2016_n_8654710.html?ir=UK+Entertainment|title=Adele Tour: '25' Singer Announces European Live Shows For 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=29 November 2015|date=26 November 2015|first=Ashley|last=Percival}}</ref><ref name="announcBilbNA">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6806082/adele-2016-us-tour-dates-north-america|title=Adele Announces 2016 North American Tour, Her First in 5 Years|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=14 December 2015}}</ref><ref name="variety.com">https://variety.com/2017/music/news/adele-cancels-shows-vocal-chord-damage-1202485261/</ref>

== Background and commercial reception ==
Adele announced the Western European headlining dates on 26 November 2015. After tickets went on sale on 4 December, many venues reported sell-outs, resulting in extra dates being added in multiple cities on the itinerary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6784895/adele-tickets-security-stubhub-scalpers|title=Adele's Ticket Sales Strategy, Looking to Stop Scalpers, Draws Criticism (and a Lot of Fans)|publisher=}}</ref>

Tickets sold out nearly instantaneously, with promoters for [[Glasgow]]'s [[SSE Hydro]] reporting tickets for the 13,000 venue sold out within two minutes. Due to the high demand, online queues were set up, which resulted in queues of over 50,000 people for venues only seating a quarter of that.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/adele-2016-star-adds-eight-6952267|title=Adele adds eight dates to UK tour after tickets sell out in seconds|first=Katy|last=Forrester|date=4 December 2015|publisher=}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==

=== Opening night ===
[[File:Adele Live 2016 tour.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|right|Adele at the [[Genting Arena]], March 2016]]
The UK tour received mostly very positive reviews. Bernadette McNulty of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the opening show at [[Odyssey (Belfast)|The SSE Arena Belfast]] five stars. She referenced the expensive secondary market ticket prices for the tour, saying that "Adele is worth every penny". McNulty states that "Adele undoubtedly has the popularity to fill endless arenas, but maintaining the attention of thousands of people used to the hi-tech extravaganzas laid on by the likes of [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Beyoncé]] can demand more flashing lights, dance routines and hydraulics than any natural talent. Her entrance was certainly theatrical, emerging from the centre of the arena underneath a main stage flanked by an Orwellian projection of her giant eyes blinking. But between that and some virtual, or possibly in Belfast real, rain, Adele kept it remarkably and effectively simple, letting nothing get in the way of what was almost a religious communion with her fans."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/adele-uk-tour-sse-belfast-review/|title=Adele proves she's worth every penny: review|work=Telegraph}}</ref> ''[[BBC News]]'' music reporter Mark Savage said that "Adele enjoyed a rapturous reception as she opened her world tour with an intimate arena show in [[Belfast]]."

Continuing his positive review, he said "even the steeliest of hearts would have been forced to concede she had brought the goods."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35690996|title=Adele review: Pop's biggest star opens world tour in Belfast|work=BBC News}}</ref> Amanda Ferguson from the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' said that "Adele is fun, charismatic and exceptionally talented" in her four star review.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/adele-in-belfast-review-down-to-earth-yet-out-of-this-world-class-act-thrills-sse-arena-34500544.html|title=Adele in Belfast review: Down to earth yet out of this world, class act thrills SSE Arena}}</ref> Alexis Petridis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' opened his review by saying that Adele "delivers a solid - if unsurprising - show on the first night of her tour". In his four star review, Petridis noted Adele saying "I know some of you have been dragged along here tonight but I'm going to win you over", before concluding that "judging by the reaction as she finally disappears - on the same platform on which she appeared - she has managed it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/29/adele-review-a-lesson-in-control-from-the-end-of-the-pier|title=Adele review - a lesson in control from the end of the pier|work=The Guardian}}</ref> Nick Hasted of ''[[The Independent]]'' gave the show three stars, saying that "she tries soul moves over gospel piano, but owes more to [[Shirley Bassey]] than [[Aretha Franklin|Aretha]]". Giving a mostly positive review, Hasted concluded the review by saying "Adele needs the nerve to make a defining leap, to become the bawdy, ballsy person she is on stage when she writes. Pop is dying for it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/adele-live-review-a-grateful-music-industry-s-remaining-force-is-with-british-singer-a6904411.html|title=Adele, SSE Arena, Belfast, review: Grateful music industry's remaining Force is with British singer|work=The Independent}}</ref>

=== The O<sub>2</sub> Arena===
[[File:Adele Sings Set Fire to the Rain Genting Arena March 2016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Adele sings "[[Set Fire to the Rain]]" at the [[Genting Arena]], March 2016]]
The critical response was overwhelmingly positive when Adele performed six shows at [[The O2 Arena|The O<sub>2</sub> Arena]] in her hometown, London. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Ashley Percival gave one of the shows five stars: "By her own admission, most of her back catalogue is "fucking miserable", and I questioned quite how the [[Tottenham]]-born songstress would hold the attention of the packed O<sub>2</sub> Arena without being able to rely on exhaustive dance routines or belting out some pop bangers to boost the energy. But the second she emerged through the floor of a small B-stage uttering those immortal words "Hello, it's me", any concerns just evaporated&amp;nbsp;— every single person in the room was in complete awe, and would stay that way for the entirety of the 18-song set."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/adele-live-2016-tour-review-london-o2-arena_uk_56ef0c24e4b030d552ef70d3|title=Adele Live 2016 Tour Review: 'A Night of Pure and Utter Class'|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref> David Smyth from the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' said that "Adele shifted constantly from being a lightning rod for emotion to a light entertainer" in his four star review. He also complimented the show's opening performance of "[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]", saying that "isolated, with her large band hidden behind the screen, [Adele] held the room without trickery&amp;nbsp;— just one of the great singing voices."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/adele-tour-review-mesmerising-return-from-one-of-the-greatest-voices-and-entertainers-a3204621.html|title=Adele, tour review: Mesmerising return from one of the greatest voices and entertainers|work=Evening Standard}}</ref> Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from the ''[[Financial Times]]'' stated in his four star review that the show "had an old-school air of professionalism, sumptuously mounted and impeccably rehearsed." Hunter-Tilney also said that "Flashy special effects were kept to a minimum, such as the downfall of water that surrounded her for "[[Set Fire to the Rain]]" towards the end. The absence of high-tech arena spectacle helped the show. It allowed Adele's personality to gain the upper hand over her professionalism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e089e53a-eb61-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8.html|title=Adele, O2 Arena, London - "Both regimented and spontaneous"|work=Financial Times}}</ref>

=== Genting Arena ===
Adele performed in the [[Genting Arena]], Birmingham on 29, 30 March and 1, 2 April 2016 in a performance described as "mesmerizing", "jaw-dropping" and "breath-taking".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/six-superb-things-adele-birminghams-11110746 | title=Six superb things Adele did at Birmingham's Genting Arena | work=Birmingham Mail | date=30 March 2016 | accessdate=4 April 2016 | author=Beardsmore, Luke}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentingarena.co.uk/whats-on/adele/adele-review|title=We're SO Not Over Adele|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Staples Center===
''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Chris Willman took aim at previous reviewers of the tour who had criticised Adele for speaking too much during the concert in his positive review of the opening night of her stint at Los Angeles' [[Staples Center]]. He said "A few critics at the earliest stops on her first U.S. arena tour have made "shut up and sing"-type suggestions… a would-be corrective measure that's unlikely to be wished for by almost any of her actual fans, who surely recognize that they're in the presence of not just one of the great singers in pop history, but one of the great ''broads''." <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7461824/adele-tour-staples-los-angeles-concert-recap | title=Adele mixes Heartbreak with Huge Laughs in Opening of L.A.

=== Domain Stadium ===
Adele's first performance in Australia at the [[Subiaco Oval|Domain Stadium]] in [[Perth]] was met with universally positive reviews. Heather McNeill of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' said Adele "was noticeably humbled by the massive crowd [the largest in West Australian concert history], admitting in her first many witty and warm chats with fans that she was a bit nervous." She named "I'll Be Waiting", "[[Rumour Has It (Adele song)|Rumour Has It]]" and "[[Water Under the Bridge (song)|Water Under the Bridge]]" as highlights calling them "flawless" and "soulful", as well as "Sweetest Devotion" and "Take It All". McNeill gave the concert five stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/adele-opens-first-australian-tour-with-flawless-perth-performance-20170228-gunmhn.html|title=Review: Adele opens first Australian tour with flawless Perth performance|work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=1 March 2017 | author=McNeill, Heather}}</ref> Simon Collins of ''[[The West Australian]]'' gave the concert four stars, claiming that "for many people, Adele's first ever Australian show and first ever stadium concert will be the best they have ever seen." He said that whilst "for many people, this was a five-star concert", for him "not so much...but like all that confetti after the show, I've been swept up in Adele fever." He concluded that "the once-in-a-generation artist and unique, yet down-to-earth, personality had left Perth fans both starstruck and with a brand new bestie." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/music-reviews/concert-review-all-hail-queen-adele-ng-b88400324z|title=Concert review: All hail, Queen Adele|work=West Australian|date=1 March 2017|author=Collins, Simon}}</ref> In a review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Bob Gordon claims that "Perth was entranced and besotted by Adele a full 48 hours before her show" so that  "by showtime, gridlock or not, Perth was fit to pop." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/01/adeles-first-australian-show-review-perth-succumbs-to-charm-and-glory|title=Adele's first Australian show review - Perth succumbs to charm and glory|work=The Guardian|date=28 February 2017|author=Gordon, Bob}}</ref>
