# Wikipedia history comparison

This repo contains the article source of various English Wikipedia articles,
imported at multiple points in their revision history (rarely the current revision).
The idea is to demonstrate how those (real) edits would be represented in Github's diff view,
in comparison to the existing MediaWiki "Difference between revisions" article history browser.

### Articles currently represented:
* [List of Asia's Next Top Model contestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asia%27s_Next_Top_Model_contestants)
  * [One IP edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=863802120&oldid=863767210&title=List_of_Asia%27s_Next_Top_Model_contestants&diffmode=source)
* [Adele Live 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Live_2016)
  * [Two edits by an IP user](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adele_Live_2016&diff=865009395&oldid=862159570&diffmode=source)
